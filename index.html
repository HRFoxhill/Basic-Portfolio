        <p> Hi, a little about me. I am a mom, pet mom, wife, roommate, auntie and friend. My life is busy and I love it. </p>
<br> </br> 
        <p>I work in the evenings as a massage therapist and go to school during the day. My weekends are all about my son and our family and making the most of our time together.</p>
<br> </br>
        <p>I am taking this class to learn more about and area of work that has touched my career but that I have yet to have the chance to interact with on a fulfilling and knowledgeable level. I hope to be able to take what I learn from this class and apply it to a new career with new learning and life opportunities.</p>
